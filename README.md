# FtpGuest
A tiny ftp web UI (based on ASP.NET MVC 5)

This is just a small ASP.NET MVC project, for private use. The goal was a rapid web access to a ftp guest folder, for friends and family. World domination was never the intention behind this software. I swear. So, nothing special here. Have a nice day.
